# Agarest: Generations of War Utilities

One day, I've playing game [Agarest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_of_Agarest_War) and think that, how should I wear a weapon to be able to use this combination skill?

I'm a programmer and I think I will write a utility.  I'm thinking about programming tool and it fit with I want to try writing on [nw.js](https://nwjs.io), and, it's answer: AgaUtils.

# AgaUtils

A simple utility with this step:

- Choose character, and optional, use "Proof of Valor" or not
- click "Choose Weapon", and program will calculate which combination skills you can use
- or click "Choose Skill", and program will calcuate which weapons you must use.

# AgaGen

It's a program to generate data and thank for [Agarest Wiki](https://agarest.fandom.com).

Please note that, program will extract data from Agarest Wiki and it's might be changed.

Currently, it's run on 2023/01/30.
